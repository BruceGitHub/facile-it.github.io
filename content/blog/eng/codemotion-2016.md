*«Learn or die»*. These are the words with which [**Codemotion Milan 2016**](http://milan2016.codemotionworld.com/) started on 25th November. Most of our development team attended this tech conference like the [previous year](http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/facile-it-devs-codemotion-milan-2015/). Moreover [Facile.it](http://www.facile.it) was present at the event as a sponsor with his stand looking for new talent.

During the event we also officially announced the second [**#FacileHack**](http://hackathon.facile.it/) planned for the next year.

This post would be a short recap of some talks in chronological order. The choice of the talk is based on the personal taste of the various members of the editorial staff of Facile.it Engineering blog.

# Day 1

## The new features of PHP 7
 * Enrico Zimuel ([@ezimuel](https://twitter.com/ezimuel))
 * 11:30 – 12:10 #programming ([slide](http://zimuel.it/slides/codemotion2016/))

Enrico Zimuel, Software Engineer at [Zend Technologies](http://www.zend.com/), the company that is behind PHP, talks about some of the new features of PHP 7: the scalar type and return type declaretions, the spaceship and null coalescing operators, the anonymous classes, the consistent 64-bit support, etc. Futhermore he explains why PHP 7 is twice as fast compared to the previous version and it has 30% lower memory consumption.

## Kubernetes and lastminute.com: our course towards better scalability and processes
 * Michele Orsi ([@micheleorsi](https://twitter.com/micheleorsi))
 * 11:30 – 12:10 #devops ([slide](http://www.slideshare.net/micheleorsi/kubernetes-and-lastminutecom-our-course-towards-better-scalability-and-processes))

Lastminute.com recently started a migration from a monolithic app to a microservice approach, leveraging the power of kubernetes, the OSS lead by Google for container orchestration. This was quite the effort, and unveiled a great deal of advantages and challenges.

## Continuous budgeting
 * Francesco Fullone ([@fullo](https://twitter.com/fullo))
 * 14:10 - 15:50 #inspirational
 
This talk is about being agile in the entrepeneur side of our profession: how to plan and adapt to change when deciding how and how much to spend in our coding ventures; re-evaluating is key, and the only way to success is a delicate balance between maintenance and improvement.

# Day 2

## Coding Culture
 * Sven Peters ([@svenpet](https://twitter.com/svenpet))
 * 10:30 - 11:10 #inspirational ([slide](http://www.slideshare.net/svenpeters/coding-culture))

In his keynote Sven Peters, Evangelist for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), explains - in a very geek style - what is *company culture* particularly referring to his company. He says that when people work in a great coding culture they are motivated and they are mostly very productive, but also more responsibility for the features they are developing. Developer will have more freedom to change their roles and try out new stuff, this is the right way to make better products with happier developers. He concluded his speech with these words: *«Products may change, but never forget values, cultivate your culture!»*.

## MicroMonolith - Top anti-patterns of adopting distributed system
 * Michal Franc ([@francmichal](https://twitter.com/francmichal))
 * 12:30 – 13:10 #architectures
 
In this talk, Michal reports his (and his team) experience in the infamous transistion from a monolithic app to a microservice oriented architecture. Michal works at [@JustGiving](https://twitter.com/JustGiving), which mainly uses .NET, but he didn't focus on the specific technology, but rather on the generic problems and pitfalls that this kind of transition brings to the table. During his tale, he laid to us a lot of useful suggestions and common issues to look for.

## Gang of Four Patterns in a Functional Light
 * Mario Fusco ([@mariofusco](https://twitter.com/mariofusco))
 * 14:10 – 14:50 #programming ([code](https://github.com/mariofusco/from-gof-to-lambda))

In this live-coding talk, Mario Fusco uses Java (and new Java 1.8 features) to translate the wide-known GoF design patterns into functional programming, making the code a lot less verbose, reducing the noise of boilerplate over the really important code.
