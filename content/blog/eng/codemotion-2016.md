## MicroMonolith - Top anti-patterns of adopting distributed system

In this talk, Michal reports his (and his team) experience in the infamous transistion from a monolithic app to a microservice
oriented architecture. Michal works at [@JustGiving](https://twitter.com/JustGiving), which mainly uses .NET, but he didn't
focus on the specific technology, but rather on the generic problems and pitfalls that this kind of transition brings to
the table. During his tale, he laid to us a lot of useful suggestions and common issues to look for.
