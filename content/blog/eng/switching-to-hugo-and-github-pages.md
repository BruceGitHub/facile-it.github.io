As you may have noticed, we went through a bit of a restyling in the last few days, and our blog changed a lot in terms of appearance and structure. 
We are very happy with those changes, but the reason behind this transition is not just a simple template change.

## GitHub pages
Before, we were using an hosted CMS to run the blog, Ghost. We were happy with the results, it wasn't our concern to administrate the server or bother about other hosting stuff.

But, as many other developers, we were hitching for something more aligned with our inclination: we wanted a tool that was closer to our skills and our daily jobs. We were having problems during the revision phase of the articles, since we couldn't work in parallel, fearing the risk of overwriting each other work. The first solution that came to us was obviously Git, the everyday tool for a team of developers working on the same piece of code (or text, in this case).
